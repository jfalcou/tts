                       **Tiny Test System**

**TTS** tests is meant to cover a large scope of checks from simple validation to complex
numeric based tests. Each category of tests macros lives in its own header and can be
included in a fine grain way.

Categories are :
- [Scenario related](#scenariodefinition) macros: those helps structure test cases.
- [Status related](#statustests) macros: those provide way to force pass or failure of tests.
- [Basic tests](#basictests) macros: those provide simple expectation checks.
- [Relational tests](#statustests) macros: those provide checks based on equality and ordering.
- [Precision related](#precisiontests) macros: those provide checks for IEEE754 comparisons.
- [Sequence related](#sequencetests) macros: those provide checks operating on sequences and containers.
- [Runtime related](#runtimeerrortests) macros: those provide checks for runtime behavior.
- [Type related](#typetests) macros: those provide checks for types comparisons.
- [Dataset related](#datasettests) macros: those provide facility to compare functions behavior over data ranges.

Scenario definition
====================================================================================================
The following component provides macros to define test cases as a simple function or as a template
function. Those are the basic blocks of writing tests with TTS. To use those macros, include the `tts/tts.hpp` file.

  (insert reference/tts_case.html     here)
  (insert reference/tts_case_tpl.html here)
  (insert reference/tts_when.html     here)
  (insert reference/tts_and_then.html here)

Status Tests
====================================================================================================
The following component provides macros to display informations about tests status within scenarios.
<br>
To use those macros, include the `tts/tests/infos.hpp` file.

  (insert reference/tts_pass.html     here)
  (insert reference/tts_fail.html     here)
  (insert reference/tts_invalid.html  here)

Basic Tests
====================================================================================================
The following component provides macros to perform basic tests over expression that simply evaluates
as a boolean value.
<br>
To use those macros, include the `tts/tests/basic.hpp` file.

  (insert reference/tts_expect.html     here)
  (insert reference/tts_expect_not.html here)

Relational Tests
====================================================================================================
The following component provides macros to perform ordering test between values.
<br>
To use those macros, include the `tts/tests/relation.hpp` file.

!!! Attention Note
   Ordering and equality comparisons are, by default, handled by the `operator==` or
   `operator<` overloads. In the case one needs to perform a custom comparison, see
   the :ref:`custom-comparison` section.

  (insert reference/tts_equal.html          here)
  (insert reference/tts_not_equal.html      here)
  (insert reference/tts_less.html           here)
  (insert reference/tts_greater.html        here)
  (insert reference/tts_less_equal.html     here)
  (insert reference/tts_greater_equal.html  here)

Precision Tests
====================================================================================================
The following component provides macros to perform precision tests between values.
<br>
To use those macros, include the `tts/tests/precision.hpp` file.

!!! Attention Note
   Precision comparisons are, by default, handled by the `tts::ulpdist`, `tts::reldist` or
   `tts::absdist` overloads. In the case one needs to perform a custom precision comparison, see
   the :ref:`custom-precision` section.

  (insert reference/tts_ulp_equal.html      here)
  (insert reference/tts_ieee_equal.html     here)
  (insert reference/tts_relative_equal.html here)
  (insert reference/tts_absolute_equal.html here)

Sequence Tests
====================================================================================================
The following component provides macros to perform tests over sequence of values. All those macros
are based on the fact that the check to perform must pass for every elements of the sequence.
<br>
For convenience, one can substitute one of two of the input sequences by a scalar that will be
interpreted as a sequence of one element.
<br>
To use those macros, include the `tts/tests/sequence.hpp` file.

!!! Attention Note
    Precision comparisons are, by default, handled by the `tts::ulpdist`, `tts::reldist` or
    `tts::absdist` overloads. In the case one needs to perform a custom precision comparison, see
    the :ref:`custom-precision` section.

  (insert reference/tts_all_equal.html          here)
  (insert reference/tts_all_ulp_equal.html      here)
  (insert reference/tts_all_ieee_equal.html     here)
  (insert reference/tts_all_relative_equal.html here)
  (insert reference/tts_all_absolute_equal.html here)

Runtime Error Tests
====================================================================================================
The following component provides macros to perform basic tests on the throwing or
absence of runtime exceptions.
<br>
Note that those test macros requires the exception to be detected to inherits from `std::exception`.
<br>
To use those macros, include the `tts/tests/exception.hpp` file.

  (insert reference/tts_throw.html      here)
  (insert reference/tts_no_throw.html   here)

Type Tests
====================================================================================================
The following component provides macros to perform tests over expression type equivalence
or properties.
<br>
To use those macros, include the `tts/tests/types.hpp` file.

  (insert reference/tts_type_is.html      here)
  (insert reference/tts_expr_is.html      here)

Dataset Tests
====================================================================================================
