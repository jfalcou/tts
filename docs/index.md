# The TTS Library

Tiny Test System is a C++ open-source Unit Test library designed following the ideas of libraries like CATCH or LEST.

In addition to classical TDD features, its main goal is to provide:

- Test over data sets
- Support for template test cases generation
- IEEE precision-related tests: ULP, absolute and relative error
- Customization points for 3rd party types
- Streamlined behavior for interaction with post-processing scripts

TTS is thus suitable for numerical-heavy testing.

# Supported Compilers

  * clang 12 and superior
  * Visual Studio 17 2022 v19.30.30709.0
