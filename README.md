## Overview

Tiny Test System is a C++ open-source Unit Test library designed following
the ideas of libraries like CATCH or LEST.

Its main goal is to provide, in addition to classical TDD features, a set of
tests for :

- IEEE precision-related testing: ULP and relative error
- Testing over arrays of data
- Exhaustive and sampling test over data sets
- A few customization points for 3rd party types

making TTS suitable for numerical-heavy testing.
